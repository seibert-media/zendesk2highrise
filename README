Description:

This is a simple hack to get email notifications from Zendesk
into Highrise (and associating those emails with the proper
deal).

Requirements:

* Python 2.X (should run on any reasonable version)
* a POP3 mailbox
* a smarthost for sending email

Installation and Usage:

Set up Zendesk to send the notifications you want to the POP3
mailbox.

You should then edit the script and change the following variables:

INCOMING_HOST
INCOMING_USER
INCOMING_PASS
OUTGOING_HOST
OUTGOING_EMAIL
DEBUG_EMAIL

You can test the script by just running it without any command line
arguments. When you got it working, just create a cron job like this:

* * * * * someuser /usr/local/bin/zendesk2highrise.py --cron
